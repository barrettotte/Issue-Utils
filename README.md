# Issue-Utils

Utilities for various issue tracking sites including Trello, GitLab, and GitKraken Glo.


## My Issue Tracking
GitLab(2018) -> Trello(2018-2019) -> GitKraken Glo(2020-?)

I'm a lone developer so I cram everything into two boards.
One is a main board and the other is a giant backlog.


## Archive - GitLab-Trello
For my first issue migration, I wrote a set of subpar Python scripts.
I only made a set of scripts for migrating from GitLab to Trello.

```python3 gitlab-export.py ; python3 trello-gitlab-import.py```

I figured I'd include this for sake of completion.
